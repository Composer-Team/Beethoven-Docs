# Beethoven Software Stack

One of the goals of Beethoven is to provide a uniform deployment and testing process across platforms:
Using an accelerator on a Zynq board should work the same as on AWS F2 and in our simulation platform.
[ChiselTest](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chiseltest/tree/main) and Verilog testbenches are excellent
for unit-testing your modules, but are cumbersome for large-scale, end-to-end testing on real datasets.

Along with the Beethoven Hardware library, we've published a software integration stack that
supports simulation and device backends, allowing you to test the exact same software binary in
simulation before you deploy it. Our simulation backend supports multiple simulators: Verilator, and
simulators that support VPI (e.g., Icarus Verilog, VCS).

We'll start by looking at a simple example that continues from the hardware design we developed in the
Beethoven Hardware stack section ([link](/Beethoven/HW)).

## A Basic Example (cont'd)

Picking up from where we left off with our vector addition core, we had just built our hardware. With
your environment properly set up (having set your `BEETHOVEN_PATH` environment variable in your bashrc),
it should have generated your hardware modules in `$BEETHOVEN_PATH/build/hw` and your C++ linkages
in `$BEETHOVEN_PATH/build/beethoven_hardware.h` and `$BEETHOVEN_PATH/build/beethoven_hardware.cc`.

### Testbench

The header should have a stub that looks like this:
```cpp
namespace myVectorAdd {
        beethoven::response_handle<bool> vector_add(
            uint16_t core_id,
            beethoven::remote_ptr vec_a_addr,
            beethoven::remote_ptr vec_b_addr,
            beethoven::remote_ptr vec_out_addr,
            uint32_t vector_length);
};
```

To use our core, let's set up a new CMake project. Your `CMakeLists.txt` will go in the root directory
of your c++ directory and will look something like this.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.30)
project(vector_add)

find_package(beethoven REQUIRED)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

beethoven_build(vector_add
    SOURCES main.cpp)

```

If you've installed the Beethoven software library correctly, `find_package` should work correctly.
`beethoven_build` is a function that declares a new target in a similar way to `add_executable`.
We'll create a new c++ source file called `main.cpp` and insert the boilerplate:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <beethoven/fpga_handle.h>
#include <beethoven_hardware.h>

using namespace beethoven;
int main() {
  fpga_handle_t handle;
  
}
```

The `fpga_handle_t` is our way of communicating with our accelerator. Once it's been constructed
somewhere in your executable, you'll be able to call your accelerator. First, let's look at the
arguments to our vector-add unit.

First, there's `core_id`. If we elaborated a multi-core accelerator, we can use this argument to
specify which core we want to execute our vector-add. Next, we have a few `beethoven::remote_ptr`
arguments for our vectors. When you use an `Address` type in a `BeethovenIO`, it will result in the
use of `beethoven::remote_ptr` in the c++ linkage.

`remote_ptr` is a smart pointer that we use for making allocations that are accessible from our
accelerator. It has `shared_ptr` semantics, so you should not need to free it. The use of this
special type is necessary because some accelerators share the same address space with the host
CPU (ex. Zynq) whereas others have discrete address spaces (ex. AWS F2). We hide the implementation
details for managing these address spaces inside the pointer type.

To allocate a slice of memory that is accessible from your accelerator, the `fpga_handle_t` exposes
a `malloc` interface that behaves like a typical C `malloc` interfaces. The `remote_ptr` allocates
a slice of memory in the host address space. You can fetch this pointer using `.getHostAddr()`,
initialize the memory and use it like a normal memory allocation.
To transfer the allocation over to the accelerator-accessible space, we use
`handle.copy_to_fpga()`.

```cpp
fpga_handle_t handle;
int size_of_int = 4;
int n_eles = 32;
auto vec_a = handle.malloc(size_of_int * n_eles);
auto vec_b = handle.malloc(size_of_int * n_eles);
auto vec_out = handle.malloc(size_of_int * n_eles);

auto vec_a_host = (int*)vec_a.getHostAddr();
auto vec_b_host = (int*)vec_b.getHostAddr();
for (int i = 0; i < n_eles; ++i) {
    vec_a_host[i] = i + 1;
    vec_b_host[i] = i * 2;
}
handle.copy_to_fpga(vec_a);
handle.copy_to_fpga(vec_b);
```

Now, to call our accelerator we use the stub:

```cpp
auto resp_handle = myVectorAdd::vector_add(0,
                                           vec_a,
                                           vec_b,
                                           vec_out,
                                           n_eles);
```

This returns a response handle. Although your accelerator is now executing, your host CPU can
continue working until you're ready to block and wait for your code to finish. Then, you
can copy your results back to host-accessible memory using `handle.copy_from_fpga(...)`.

```cpp
auto response = resp_handle.get()
handle.copy_from_fpga(vec_out);
```

If you want to check if your code has finished, but not block if it hasn't, then we also offer a `try_get()`.
The `response` payload will be the struct specified by your accelerator core `BeethovenIO` if you
specified one. If you specified no response acknowledgement, `.get()` will throw an error.

### Run your code

Now we have our testbench. To simulate our code, we'll start up the Beethoven Runtime.
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="a" label="Simulation (Icarus Verilog)" default>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Composer-Team/Beethoven-Runtime
cd Beethoven-Runtime
bash setup_dramsim.sh
# this will build and run the simulator
make sim_icarus
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="b" label="Simulation (VCS)">
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Composer-Team/Beethoven-Runtime
cd Beethoven-Runtime
bash setup_dramsim.sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTARGET=sim -DSIMULATOR=vcs
make -j
../scripts/build_vcs.sh

# run the runtime/simulator
./BeethovenTop
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="c" label="Simulation (Verilator)">
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Composer-Team/Beethoven-Runtime
cd Beethoven-Runtime
bash setup_dramsim.sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTARGET=sim -DSIMULATOR=verilator
make -j

# run the runtime/simulator
./BeethovenRuntime
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="d" label="AWS F2">
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Composer-Team/Beethoven-Runtime
cd Beethoven-Runtime
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTARGET=fpga -DBACKEND=F2
make -j

# run the runtime
sudo ./BeethovenRuntime
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="e" label="Zynq">
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Composer-Team/Beethoven-Runtime
cd Beethoven-Runtime
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTARGET=fpga -DBACKEND=Kria
make -j

# run the runtime
sudo ./BeethovenRuntime
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Each one of these simulation platforms should provide the same results. We recommend
using either VCS or Icarus Verilog for simulation because they support tri-state logic (X, Z).
We've also found instances where the Verilator compile time becomes prohibitively long (hours)
whereas simulation + running for the others is a matter of a few minutes.

Once your simulator is running, compile and run your testbench binary like so.
```sh
# inside your c testbench directory
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
./vector_add
```

This will execute your accelerator core! Now you can quit the runtime and view the
waveform for your execution.

In Verilator, CTRL+C is sufficient. For VCS and Icarus, CTRL+C to exit to the simulation
shell and run `finish`. This will ensure the waveform is properly flushed.

## Beethoven Runtime

When using the runtime over a real FPGA, the runtime manages all communication between host
processes and the device. It is responsible for moving over commands as well as polling the
FPGA for responses. The rate of this polling is configurable in the source file 
`src/response_poller.cc` [[link]](https://github.com/Composer-Team/Beethoven-Runtime/blob/master/src/response_poller.cc)
if you wish to increase or decrease the rate. By default, it is set to 10Âµs.

### Discrete Device Allocator

When operating on a discrete device, Beethoven provides a thread-safe allocator implementation
so that separate threads and processes can fully utilize the FPGA's memory space without
relying on inter-process communication to synchronize allocations.

The allocator maintains allocation state entirely in the runtime process and stores nothing inside
the FPGA memory. It is a slab-based allocator with 2MB slabs and a minimum allocation size of 4KB.
Allocations of less than 4KB will not fault, but will incur external fragmentation.

[[Implementation]](https://github.com/Composer-Team/Beethoven-Software/blob/master/include/beethoven/allocator/device_allocator.h)

### Embedded Device Allocator

When the accelerator device shares the address space with the host CPU, the operating system needs
to know about the allocations that we make. Currently, we don't support virtual addressing on the
Zynq platforms, so we use Linux [[hugepages]](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.html)
to make physical memory allocations that are larger than 4KB. When running on a Zynq system,
Beethoven's `malloc` uses `mmap` to allocate the memory and then obtains the virtual to physical
mapping from the OS.

We provide a script [here](https://github.com/Composer-Team/Beethoven/blob/main/bin/kria/kria_mm.py) for
pre-allocating hugepages on Zynq platforms.
